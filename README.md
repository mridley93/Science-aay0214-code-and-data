# Science-aay0214-code-and-data

This repository contains the data and code used to make the figures in Ridley, Rao, Schilbach and Patel (2020).

To re-create a particular figure, open "Code" and run the file named for that figure. The figure will be saved in "Output". 

.do files should be run in Stata 15 or later (they may run in earlier versions but I cannot guarantee this). To run the .R files, you might first have to install the packages listed at the start of the file.

"Raw Data" contains the data either as downloaded from the internet or as compiled from other published papers. For data sources, see the figure captions in the paper.

The folders "Cleaned Data" and "temp" contain files used by the code in the process of making the figures.
